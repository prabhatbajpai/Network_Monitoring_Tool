# Network_Monitoring_Tool
Our Network-Analyzer uses Tcpcump shell tool to capture packets. It process tcpdump's output and extracts Source Mac, Destination Mac, Source IP, DEstination IP, Source port, Destination port, Packet length and timestamp and stores them in database. As it is an authentication based application packet capturing starts at login, Packet details can be seen in other page. User can refresh database whenever he wants. At the time of logout packet database is again flushed. This app runs on apache server, Mysql is used for database management. Packet capture and processing is done by shell scrpit. An additional database is maintained for keeping track of authentic users. Contents of that database are exported in login_database.sql file. For running this application some other permissions are needed to be given to www-data . As www-data need to run tcpdump and and write files, this can be done manually using shell.
